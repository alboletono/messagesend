This little application allows to send messages between PCs on the same network.

You can edit a simple properties file to manage the users you want to send message. You can sort these users into categories.

I have to do a lot of java warning cleanings but the application is working and has been used by several co workers.

The interest for me as a developper was to use some windows system calls and to map them to java. I tried to use some java API to make these calls (for messaging) but never make it worked. So I have given up.

So there is a small part in C that are mapped with JNI.
